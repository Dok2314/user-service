## User Service (RBAC Core)

A **universal RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) service** built with Laravel as a delivery layer, designed following **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **CQRS**, and **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** principles.

The project focuses on a **clean, framework-independent domain model**, explicit use cases, and clear separation between **domain, application, and infrastructure layers**.  
It is intended to serve as a reusable authorization core or a standalone microservice for managing users, roles, and permissions in scalable systems.
